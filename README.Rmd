Getting and Cleaning Data
==========================================
## Files


`CodeBook.md` describes the data, which explains the variables and the processes that were used to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The output of the 5th step is called `averages_data.txt`, and uploaded in the course project's form.
